- 🐝 Bees don’t have feelings the same way humans do
- 🖤 You can fall for a bee, but a bee will never fall for you
- ✨ The bee can catch your eye a thousand times
- 🥀 But it won’t spare you a look as it passes by
- 💞 If you want to make your love with a bee come true

- Then boy do the cops have some bad news for you
